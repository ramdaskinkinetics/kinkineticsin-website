      Our journey began with an MVP focused on a road scenario—determining the optimal way to avoid obstacles in time-pressured situations. With an impressive 96% accuracy rate, this was just the beginning. From controlling car safety systems to parachute deployments, firefighting operations, and even space exploration, our goal is to apply this technology across diverse, high-pressure domains.
